The Tar.gz file that I submitted is without using an snmp simulator

When i tried and configuring the to reach the 192.168.1184.23:161(one of the ip addresses from the Archievs)

I opened  the \etc\...\snmp file using sudo nano \....\snmp to edit and add that udp and community string to it and tried  walking the ip address with that community string but failed to reach.

I can make the ip 192.168.184.23 to listen by considering it as a unix endpoint but cant read it as udpv4 endpoint.

If im doing any thing wrong  during configuring simulator i hope i didnt i made the following changes pleases correct if anything wrong.

From all the sections in the config file i have re wrote and given a community string for the ip address and also commented out in AGENT BEHAVIOUR section and allowed snmp to listen to all UDP addressess i wanted to reach but that also didnt work.


In order to get a snapshot of tghe device i should able to connect to the  network but that never happened

Please let me know if im going in actual way or its completely out of the way?

PLease correct me...
